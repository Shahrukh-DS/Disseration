Analysing Climate Change Using Machine Learning
In this study, we provide a machine learning based analysis on the climate change patterns around the globe based on temperature anomalies in the period from 2013 to 2022. The approach included organised collection of data and pre-processing well as feature extraction to categorise the countries in terms of temperature change severity. On the basis of the average temperature anomaly among the four phases, a binary classification label, High Change and Low Change was established, allowing the use of four machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost. EDA disclosed global, and continent-specific warming trends, and performance of the model was evaluated based on the accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and confusion matrices. Of  the models, SVM had the best test accuracy (0.7929) and logistic regression was close (0.7899). Precision and recall curves demonstrated better SVM  prediction of positive cases at the expense of slightly poorer random forest predictions. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning improved predictive performance of each model. In conclusion, the results confirm the applicability of machine learning algorithms to climate change features recognition, and indicate SVM and Logistic Regression as the two most stable classifiers over the experiments.
